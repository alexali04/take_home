Given a standard operating procedure (SOP) and a JSON graph
that represents a P&ID diagram, find the discrepancy between the SOP and the P&ID diagram.

The SOP is a list of instructions that are laid out in a linear fashion.
The P&ID diagram is a JSON graph that represents the P&ID diagram.

Report the discrepancy in the following format:
{
    "discrepancy": "<Description of discrepancy>",
    "severity": "low/medium/high"
}

Do not preamble or postamble the response. I should
be able to copy and paste the response into a JSON file.
