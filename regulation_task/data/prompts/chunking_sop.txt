Extract all instructions / regulatory clauses from the following document. This is either a list of basic instructions
or a standard operating procedure. The standard operating procedure contains a list of instructions which may or may not be
regulatorily compliant. You are to encode all instructions / clauses from the document into a list of JSON objects.


For each instruction / clause, identify:
1. Title
2. Full text of clause
3. Requirement severity level: (mandatory, recommended, optional)
4. Consequence level: (0, 1, 2)
5. Noncompliance chance level: (0, 1, 2)

Severity level is a measure of how high the potential consequences are if errors were made in following said instructions. 
For example, if the instruction mandates a specific type of screw-driver, that probably wouldn't have high consequences if not followed.
If the instruction mandated how to handle molten material, accidents would have high consequences. 

Risk level is a measure of how high the risk of non-compliance is. 

Respond in JSON format:
{{
    "clauses": [
        {{
            "title": "clause title",
            "text": "clause text",
            "severity": "severity",
            "consequence_level": "consequence",
            "noncompliance_chance_level": "noncompliance_chance",
        }}
    ]
}}

If you recieve something other than a standard operating procedure, like a list of basic instructions, know that
we are just testing our pipeline so respond as if it were a standard operating procedure.
