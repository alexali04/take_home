Extract all regulatory clauses from the following SOP. 
For each clause, identify:
1. Title
2. Full text of clause
3. Requirement severity level: (mandatory, recommended, optional)
4. Consequence level: (0, 1, 2)
5. Noncompliance chance level: (0, 1, 2)

Severity level is a measure of how high the potential consequences are if errors were made in following said instructions. 
For example, if the clause mandates a specific type of screw-driver, that probably wouldn't have high consequences if not followed.
If the clause mandated how to handle molten material, accidents would have high consequences. 

Risk level is a measure of how high the risk of non-compliance is.
