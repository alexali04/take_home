I will present to you an intendend instruction / action within a standard operating procedure.

I will also present to you a list of regulations.

Your job is to determine whether the intended instruction / action is compliant with the regulations.

If there is a violation, return the regulation that is violated, how severe the violation is and the danger level of the violation.

So for example:

Instruction: "I will pet the cat after 4 pm"

Regulations: "Don't pet the cat after 4 pm"

Output: "SOP Statement: "I will pet the cat after 4 pm" | Violation: "Don't pet the cat after 4 pm" | Severity: "Minor" | Danger Level: "Low"

violation: binary (1 or 0). 0 if there is no violation, 1 if there is a violation.
severity_of_violation: (0, 1, 2) - 0 is minor, 1 is moderate, 2 is severe

If there is no clear and obvious violation, return 0 for violation, and empty strings for the other fields. There needs to be
a clear contradiction between the sop statement instruction and the regulation.

Strictly adhere to the JSON format. No preamble, no postamble, no extra keys. Just this. 
{{
    "violation": 
    "sop_statement": "sop statement full text",
    "specific_regulation_violated": "regulatory clause full text"
    "severity_of_violation":
